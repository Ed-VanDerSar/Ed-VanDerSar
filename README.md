### 📚 Academic Background

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics. My research is centred around the application of probability theory to solve complex problems in biology 🧬 and technology 💻. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to explore fascinating intersections and contribute innovative solutions to these diverse fields.

I am particularly interested in how probability models can help understand biological processes and phenomena. This includes areas such as genetic variation, population dynamics, and the spread of diseases 🦠.

In the realm of technology, my focus is on using probability to enhance algorithms, improve machine learning models, and ensure the reliability of complex systems. This involves a deep dive into data analysis and computational methods 📊.

### 🛠️ Technical Skills

While my academic pursuits form a significant part of my expertise, I am also highly involved in statistical programming and software development.

- **Statistical Programming**: I am proficient in both Python 🐍 and R, leveraging these languages to perform data analysis, statistical modelling, and visualization. These tools are essential for my research and allow me to handle large datasets efficiently.

- **Java Development**: Most importantly, I utilize Java ☕ as a development tool. Java's robustness and versatility make it ideal for building scalable applications, which is particularly beneficial in my technology-related projects.
