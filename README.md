## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

---

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics. My research is centred around applying probability theory to solve complex problems in biology ðŸ§¬ and technology ðŸ’». 

I am particularly interested in how probability models can help understand biological processes and phenomena. This includes genetic variation, population dynamics, and the spread of mutations.

In the realm of technology, my focus is on using probability to enhance algorithms, improve stochastic models, and ensure the reliability of complex systems. This involves a deep dive into data analysis and computational methods ðŸ“Š.
